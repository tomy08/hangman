This is a simple implementation of the classic Hangman game in PHP.

## How to Play

1. Run the `index.php` file.
2. The game will randomly select a word from a predefined list.

4. You can also guess the entire word at once.
5. If you need a hint, type 'hint' and the game will provide a clue based on the word's category.
6. You have 6 tries to guess the word. If you guess a letter that is not in the word, you lose a try.
7. The game ends when you have guessed the word or when you have used up all your tries.
